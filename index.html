      <p class="lead">In this project, I wanted to produce a commercial video featuring a very common Chinese dish, Tomato Egg Noodle.</p>
      <p>The overall video is a food commercial aiming to attract potential customers. It includes several important cooking procedures and almost all the main ingredients. It does not have specific instructions. And it uses close up shots and slow-motion to provide details.</p>
      <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f3r11vUJ2ZI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </div>

      <br>
      <p>Instead of shooting an instruction video, I thought that if I could make a very plain food interesting, then I could make any food fancy. So I chose this entry-level dish. The ingredients are very common, and the procedure is fairly simple. There are Tomato, Eggs, and Noodle. The most challenging part of the whole process would be making the scrambled egg.</p> 
      <p>Initially, I thought the shots would be easy since the cooking part is simple. However, I found it was very hard. The first challenge is to put the food in focus.  I use a lot of closeup shots and very shallow depth of the field since I wanted to blur the background. In the meantime, I needed the ingredient is in focus while it's moving. I repeated shooting the same process again and again so that I can choose the best one.</p>
      <p>The second challenge is lightning. It was easy when we prepare the ingredients. We shot in front of the window in the afternoon and the natural lights are just about right. However, when we moved to the countertop and stove latter in the day, everything looks dark and muddy. This happened when I implement the last video assignment. I regret that I did not invest in studio lights. Instead, I hung two light bulbs above the stove so that I could get enough lights for slow motion. The disadvantage was that the lights are too sharp and the color temperature was cold.</p>
      <p>Finally, I started editing in the last week. The overall cooking process took about 3 hours. Since it will be a commercial video, I needed it to be short. So I extracted the essentials and cut it into 1 minute. The fun part was when I recorded sound effects and added them to the clips.</p>
   
      <p>Sound Effects:
        <ul>
          <li>Stove Fire</li>
          <li>Frying Eggs</li>
          <li>Boiling Water</li>
          <li>Knive</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
